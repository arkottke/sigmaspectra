Now that you have installed SigmaSpectra there are some important
aspects of the program you need to be informed about:

(1) A complete reference to the program can be found via the program's
help menu, or by pressing F1.  The documentation can also be found in
PDF form in the program's installation path unless the documentation was
disabled during the installation.

(2) SigmaSpectra does not calculate a target acceleration-response
spectrum.  The target acceleration-response spectrum must calculated
externally and then input into the program by copying and pasting from a
spreadsheet, or manually entering values.  When copying and pasting from
a spreadsheet the rows are automatically adding to fit the data.

(3) SigmaSpectra requires that the time series in the motion library
follow the NGA (http://peer.berkeley.edu/nga/) format with respect to
both header information and file naming convention.  The file naming
convention is '<EARTHQUAKE>/<STATION><COMPONENT>.AT2'.  SigmaSpectra
requires that the station and component portions of the name be retained
as they are used to distinguish components from a given station.
