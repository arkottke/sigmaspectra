<h2>Tutorial</h2>

<p>Prior to using UTMS to select and scaled ground motions two items are
required:
<ol>
<li>a target response spectrum and standard deviation, and</li>
<li>a library of motions that are representative of the scenario event.</li>
</ol>
In this tutorial, motions will be selected to represent a magnitude 7
earthquake generated by a strike-slip fault at a distance of 20 km.</p>

<h3>Target Response Spectrum</h3>

<p>Specifying the target response spectrum in SigmaSpectra is as easy as
copying points from a spreadsheet (or tab delimited text file) and pasting
(with Ctrl+v) the data points into the table.  In this example, using the
Abrahamason and Silva (1997) attenuation relationship and the characteristics
of the scenario event a target response spectrum and standard deviation is
generated.

The columns respectively represent oscillator period (s), spectral acceleration
(g), and standard deviation in natural log space.  Hi-light this data and copy
it (Ctrl+c) and then click on the "Target Response Spectrum" table and paste the
data (Ctrl+v).

<h3>Library of Motions</h3>

<p>Developing a library of motions that is representative of the scenario even.  The current version only
supports the automatic loading of AT2 files obtained from the <a
	href="http://peer.berkeley.edu/nga">PEER NGA database</a>.  The following
is an example of the directory structure recommended to be used:
<pre>
motions/HECTOR:
HEC000.AT2	HEC090.AT2

motions/DUZCE:
1060-E.AT2  1060-N.AT2  531-E.AT2  531-N.AT2

motions/KOBE:
NIS000.AT2  NIS090.AT2

motions/LOMAP:
G01000.AT2  G06000.AT2  GIL067.AT2  LOB000.AT2  SJTE225.AT2  UC2000.AT2
G01090.AT2  G06090.AT2  GIL337.AT2  LOB090.AT2  SJTE315.AT2  UC2090.AT2

motions/SFERN:
L04111.AT2  L04201.AT2  L09021.AT2  L09291.AT2  L12021.AT2  L12291.AT2
</pre>
This type of formatting allows for motions recorded at the same station for
different earthquakes to be used and the earthquake can be easily read in the
output.  It is also possible to store the records in several subdirectories or
in a single directory.  In any case, the program will find all AT2 files below
the selected directory and load them -- only files starting with a '.' are
ignored.</p>
