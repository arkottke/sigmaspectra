<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

<p>SigmaSpectra is a computer program that allows for ground motions to be
selected from a library of motions to fit both a target median response
spectrum and standard deviation.  A detailed description of the methodology is
presented <a href="method.html">here</a>.  If this is your first time using
SigmaSpectra please read through the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The program was developed by Albert Kottke as part of his Master's and
Doctoral research with Professor Ellen Rathje at the University of Texas at
Austin.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: There has been little work to validate the results of
this scaling method with results obtained through other scaling methods.
However, because of the level of automation provided it is easy to generate
suites of motions without considering aspect of the ground motions not captured
by the response spectrum.  This program is not a substitute for engineering
judgement.</p>

<p>The SigmaSpectra program is released under the GNU Public License (GPLv3)
    therefore the installer has the option of installing the source code.</p>
